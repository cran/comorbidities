\title{
Produces a comorbidity count based on the AHRQ comorbidity index v3.6, based on the Elixhauser method
}
\description{
This function take as input a data frame structured such that each row contains a list of ICD-9-CM codes attributed 
to a single patient. The function goes from row to row comparing the ICD-9-CM codes a patient has with the AHRQ
comorbidity index diagnosis codes.  If a patient has a diagnosis (as indicated by ICD-9-CM code) that belongs to one 
of the AHRQ diagnoses, then the patient is considered to have this diagnosis.  Regardless of how many different 
ICD-9-CM codes a patient has corresponding to a particular comorbidity category, a comorbidity is only counted once.

The value returned consists of a vector and a data frames. The vector is the total comorbidity count.  
In the data frame returned each row in the data frame is devoted to a particular patient, and each column is 
a diagnosis.  The data frame codes a 0 if the patient does not have that diagnosis and 1 if the patient does have 
that diagnosis.  
}
\usage{
ahrq(input.frame)
}

\arguments{
  \item{input.frame}{
This is a data frame with 5 character ICD-9-CM codes without decimal points
}
}
\details{
The ICD-9-CM codes must be 5 characters long and have no decimal poinst.If any codes are less than 5 digits, then
they must be led by zeroes or followed by the letter "X" to create a 5 character code.  No more than 2 "X" ' s can
be used at the tail end, or a meaningful ICD-9-CM code cannot be derived.  If your ICD-9-CM codes contain decimals
or some other filler character, then they must be converted to the format above for this function to work properly.
}
\value{
A list of one vector and one data frames
	\item{COMORBIDITY.CT}{A vector containing the number of comorbidtities for each patient}
	\item{COMORBIDITIES}{A data frame denoting which diagnoses each patient has with a 1}
